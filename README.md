**Project Motivation**

Studying as an NUS student can be a very lonely and stressful experience. However, we believe that this experience doesn’t have to be this hard. We want to make a social media web application that has 2 very distinct purposes, but ultimately brings students together to help one another in their academic journeys.

The key feature of our app is to connect students who are currently taking the same classes who just want a friend to study with. Studying for many hours a day, especially during examination season can be very lonely, which isn’t what you want from your college experience. What better than to make friends and meet new people while still working towards your goals?


**Project Aim**

We aim to help students who are looking for study partners to ignite a spark in their mundane lives.

**User Stories**

As a student who is struggling with certain concepts in a module, I want to meet a senior who has been through it before and done well to help me.

As a student who always studies alone at home and is too shy to approach others in my faculty, I want to make friends in college and find others to study with so that studying will not be such a boring routine for me.

**Key Features of App**

The main feature of the app will be for students searching for studying partners. Students will key in some information about themselves such as their course, year of study, hobbies, timetable and place of residence (hall and own residence). The search engine will provide a filter for students to find others within the same faculty, similar interests or stay in the same area. Students will then be able to use an in-app chat to arrange for study sessions be it on campus on weekdays or off campus on weekends (flexibility given to the users). 

We are also looking to extend the app for students from other universities to use. Students can use their email from their respective universities to register for an account and search for study partners from within their schools or other universities if they wish to do so.
